A Django app for recording and keeping track of expenses. Designed in particular for groups of more than two people with shared expenses, involving multiple currencies (exchange rates are taken from https://exchangeratesapi.io/, the European Central Bank API).

Both single and recurring expenses can be added and categorised, and are displayed in a monthly breakdown. The app keeps track of who has paid how much, and therefore how much each user owes/is owed. Paybabcks can be recorded and are accounted for in the balances.

Set up to be deployed on Heroku using PostgreSQL.
